# fuel-efficiency


Here are **three advanced pathways** to further elevate this function into operational-grade modules:

---

### ✅ 1. **Mission-Critical Python Library Template (`opt_fuel/`)**

Transform this logic into a reusable, unit-safe Python package with versioning, test coverage, and Lint/type-check CI:

```bash
opt_fuel/
├── __init__.py
├── core.py              # contains optimize_fuel_efficiency
├── units.py             # pint setup and Quantity wrappers
├── exceptions.py        # e.g., InvalidPhysicalParameterError
├── tests/
│   ├── test_core.py
│   └── test_units.py
├── pyproject.toml       # packaging metadata
├── README.md
└── .github/workflows/
    └── ci.yml
```

Optional: Export to shared memory or flight controller through `struct.pack` interface for use in real-time subsystems.

### ✅ 2. **Auto-Conversion to Embedded C (with Unit Enforcer)**

Use `mypyc` or `Cython` to convert this logic into a Python–C hybrid for embedded avionics use:

```c
double optimize_fuel_efficiency(double thrust, double drag, double sfc) {
    if (thrust <= 0.0 || drag <= 0.0 || sfc <= 0.0) return -1.0;
    return thrust / (drag * sfc);
}
```

Compile into `.so`/`.dll` and call from microcontroller with strict timing guarantees.

---

### ✅ 3. **Quantum Optimizer Hook**

Embed this function as a baseline comparator in a QAOA-based quantum optimizer (e.g., for route–thrust–load trade-offs):

```python
def classical_baseline_cost(thrusts, drags, sfcs):
    return sum(optimize_fuel_efficiency(t, d, s) for t, d, s in zip(thrusts, drags, sfcs))
```

Then compare with QAOA-evolved cost surfaces to evaluate quantum advantage in sub-systems like Q-Thrust Modulation Control.

Let me know if you’d like:

* ✅ Full test suite with `pytest + hypothesis`
* ✅ C99 or embedded-safe implementation for RTOS
* ✅ Integration into a QAOA-layer for mission optimization
* ✅ YAML-based config + telemetry logging integration

Each of these can be pre-integrated into your GAIA-QAO Digital Twin architecture or MCP message-passing agents.
